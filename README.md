# Comfort/Reaction Object/Toy

My idea is to create fully portable soft toy or shape that reacts to the amount of light in the enviroment around it by lighting up. I will attempt to give it different and interesting light patterns.

## Summary

The Comfort/Reaction Object/Toy is going to be a handheld cloth object that lights up. The object will be portable and entirely hand-made. The lights will switch back and forth between a number of different hues and brightnesses, and will change based off the light in the enviroment around the toy. I will be using sewable electronics so that it can be portable.

The main idea of my project is to create an object that can sooth using color and knows when it is dark enough for it's color to be seen. The object will also, hypothetically, be able to be manipulated into changing its hue and brightness by the user. I will be using the flora Light sensor as my sensor.

## Challenges

I feel like the hardest part of this assignment for me was the coding of the lights and the intergration of the light sensors. I have experience with using conductive thread, sewable electronics and LED's together, but this will be my first time creating something using both coding and sewing. The coding for the light sensor was very complicated and I had a lot of trouble getting it to connect to the lights. I also had trouble with my timing because I had to re-sew the conductive thread whenever it got too loose, and this took up a lot of my time.


## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Finished deciding on idea and started ordering parts that I needed.
- Week 3: Practiced sewing with conductive thread, ordered different lights, Begin
- Week 4:
- Week 5: Present!
